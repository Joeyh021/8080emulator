# 8080emulator
An intel 8080 emulator and dissasembler, written in C. 

It doesn't actually do much besides execute instructions, but it successfully runs cpudiag.asm (which can be found [here](http://www.emulator101.com/files/cpudiag.asm), a piece of code designed to test every instruction on an 8080. I didnt implement the DAA instructions, so i just jumped over those in the code.
